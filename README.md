## Karabiner

If you add a new keyboard and you will use macos automatic keyboard settings, it could swap `non_us_backslash` -> `grave_accent_and_tilde` or `grave_accent_and_tilde` -> `non_us_backslash`.

My keybinds will then not be working for AltGr+Q, so you have to manually change `karabiner.json` configuration.
